## Case Study 1 - Salary Data Analysis Using ANOVA

Overview:


Salary is hypothesized to depend on educational qualification and occupation. To understand the dependency, the salaries of 40 individuals [SalaryData.csv] are collected and each person’s educational qualification and occupation are noted. Educational qualification is at three levels, High school graduate, Bachelor, and Doctorate. Occupation is at four levels, Administrative and clerical, Sales, Professional or specialty, and Executive or managerial. A different number of observations are in each level of education – occupation combination.

[Assume that the data follows a normal distribution. In reality, the normality assumption may not always hold if the sample size is small.]
